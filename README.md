# Sentiment-Analysis-Hadoop

### Introduction:
Sentiment analysis is the analysis of peopleâ€™s opinions, sentiments, evaluations, appraisals, attitudes and
emotions in relation to entities like individuals, products, events, services, organizations and topics by
classifying the expressions as negative / positive opinions.

### Scope of work:
In this project we  will be trying to do sentiment analysis of the opinions on twitter using
Hadoop Eco - System. The reason we chose twitter is because the social media is gaining popularity for the customer reviews and it is also creating a good business -
customer relationship in the market. The reviews would certainly reflect the service of the company in the market.
